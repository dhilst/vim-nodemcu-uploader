This plugin is a tiny interface over https://github.com/kmpm/nodemcu-uploader.

# Installation 

The recommeded way of installing is with Vundle:
https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim. Since this is the way I'm using and
testing it.

Follow Vundle installation instructions at
https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#quick-start. Then add `Plugin:
dhilst/vim-nodemcu-uploader` between `call vundle#begin()` and `call
vundle#end()`, restart vim and run `:Plugin Install`. See Vundle documentation
for more information on plugins installation.

After intalled do check the documentation with `:help vim-nodemcu-uploader.txt`
inside vim.
